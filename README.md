# To do List

Hi! This is going to be a to do list created using JavaScipt, TypeScript and Next, along with several other libraries. It's been developed by [me] using [Mario's] CRUD course as a guidance. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

# Features
As it was mentioned earlier, this is going to be a to do list. In it you'll be able to:

- Create new tasks
-- Each created task has a unique ID, generated using [uuid]
- Set tasks are complete
-- When you click the checkbox to set a task as complete, the content of that task is going to be crossed, to make it clear that it's finished.
- Delete tasks
-- By clicking the "Delete" button, you can delete tasks from the list
- Alter the color schema of the page
-- By choosing an item from the dropdown list, you can change the color schema of the page

# Testing
The application has been tested using Cypress. The tests are located inside cypress/e2e.
