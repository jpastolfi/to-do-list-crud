# To do List

Hi! This is going to be a to do list created using JavaScipt, TypeScript and Next. It's been developed by [me] using [Mario's] CRUD course as a guidance. I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.

# Features
As it was mentioned earlier, this is going to be a to do list. In it you'll be able to:

- Create new tasks
-- Each created task has a unique ID, generated using [uuid]
- Edit the tasks you have created
- Delete tasks
